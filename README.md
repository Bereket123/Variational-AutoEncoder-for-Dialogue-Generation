## Dataset

Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (http://www.iulianserban.com/Files/UbuntuDialogueCorpus.zip)

This link contains a pre-processed versions of the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, which was used by Serban et al. (2016a) and Serban et al. (2016b) and originally developed by Lowe et al. (2015). There are three datasets: the natural language dialogues, the noun representations and the activity-entity representations. Each dataset is split into train, valid and test sets.

The task investigated by Serban et al. (2016a) and Serban et al. (2016b) is dialogue response generation. Given a dialogue context (**one or several utterances**), the dialogue model must generate an appropriate response (**a single utterance**).
The context and response pairs are provided (see "ResponseContextPairs" subdirectories).
The model responses by Serban et al. (2016a) and Serban et al. (2016b) are also provided (see "ModelPredictions" subdirectories).

    *Context Examples:*
    1. anyone knows why my stock oneiric exports env var ' **unknown** I mean what is that used for ? I know of $USER but not $USERNAME . My precise install doesn't export USERNAME __eou__ __eot__ looks like it used to be exported by lightdm , but the line had the comment " // **unknown** : Is this required ?" so I guess it isn't surprising it is gone __eou__ __eot__ thanks ! How the heck did you figure that out ? __eou__ __eot__ https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/864109/comments/3 __eou__ __eot__
    2. i set up my hd such that i have to type a passphrase to access it at boot . how can i remove that passwrd , and just boot up normal . i did this at install , it works fine , just tired of having reboots where i need to be at terminal to type passwd in . help ? __eou__ __eot__ backup your data , and re-install without encryption " might " be the easiest method __eou__ __eot__
    3. im trying to use ubuntu on my macbook pro retina __eou__ i read in the forums that ubuntu has a apple version now ? __eou__ __eot__ not that ive ever heard of .. normal ubutnu should work on an intel based mac . there is the PPC version also . __eou__ you want total control ? or what are you wanting exactly ? __eou__ __eot__
    4. no suggestions ? __eou__ links ? __eou__ how can i remove luks passphrase at boot . i dont want to use feature anymore ... __eou__ __eot__ you may need to create a new volume __eou__ __eot__ that leads me to the next question lol ... i dont know how to create new volumes exactly in cmdline , usually i use a gui . im just trying to access this server via usb loaded with next os im going to load , the luks pw is stopping me __eou__ __eot__ for something like that I would likely use something like a live gparted disk to avoid the conflict of editing from the disk __eou__ __eot__
    5. I just added a second usb printer but not sure what the uri should read - can anyone help with usb printers ? __eou__ __eot__ firefox localhost : 631 __eou__ __eot__ firefox ? __eou__ __eot__ yes __eou__ firefox localhost : 631 __eou__ firefox http://localhost:631 __eou__ cups has a web based interface __eou__ __eot__
    
    *Ground-truth respective responses examples:*
    1. nice thanks ! __eou__
    2. so you dont know , ok , anyone else ? __eou__ you are like , yah my mouse doesnt work , reinstall your os lolol what a joke __eou__
    3. just wondering how it runs __eou__
    4. you cant load anything via usb or cd when luks is running __eou__ it wont allow usb boot , i tried with 2 diff usb drives __eou__
    5. i was setting it up under the printer configuration __eou__ thanks ! __eou__
    
## Results

Responses generated by LSTM model using beam search with 5 beams (top 1 responses):

    that 's what I was looking for :) __eou__
    how do i do that ? __eou__
    i want to install ubuntu on a mac __eou__
    is there a way to do it with the live cd ? __eou__
    is that what you mean ? __eou__
    **unknown** . cfg __eou__
    **unknown** __eou__
    I have no idea . __eou__
    **unknown** __eou__
    **unknown** ? __eou__
    I have no idea about that one , sorry . __eou__
    is there a way to fix it ? __eou__
    ? __eou__
    **unknown** ? __eou__
    is there a way to kill the process ? __eou__
    ? __eou__
    **unknown** __eou__
    I am using ubuntu on the same drive __eou__
    the latest version ? __eou__
    **unknown** __eou__

Responses generated by VHRED model using beam search with 5 beams (top 1 responses):

    it seems to be the only way to do it . __eou__
    problem is that i am not able to boot into the live cd , i can access it from the live cd , but i dont know how to use it __eou__
    i dont know how to do that __eou__
    ok i will try that , thanks __eou__
    I don't know how to do that __eou__
    hold shift during boot to get to the grub menu __eou__
    try **unknown** __eou__
    does it show up in fdisk -l ? __eou__
    That 's the problem . I don't know what that is . __eou__
    I know , but I want to know if it is possible to get it to work on my laptop __eou__
    sounds like you need to install the sun-java6-plugin package __eou__
    I see , thanks for the help __eou__
    that 's what I thought . __eou__
    as far as I know , I have no idea __eou__
    thank you very much , I'll try that __eou__
    hmm __eou__ you have a usb stick ? __eou__
    well you need to add the ppa to your sources . list and add it to your sources . list __eou__
    I just want to install ubuntu on my laptop __eou__
    can you help me with that ? __eou__
    There is a package called " lm-sensors " in the top right of the screen . __eou__
